# AMI-Style Blueprinting

# Step 1: create software repository
# Function: the purpose of the software repo is to store ISO/OVA files for vRA/vRO to pull during the provisioning process.

docker run -dit --name e2e-sw-repo -p 8080:80 -v //usr/local/vmw-e2e/data:/usr/local/apache2/htdocs/ httpd:2.4

# Step 2: upload images to /usr/local/vmw-e2e/data directory
# Function: these images will be used as the base AMIs available for consumption. In this example, we're using 
# the CentOS-7-x86_64-Minimal.iso from http://isoredirect.centos.org/centos/7/isos/x86_64/CentOS-7-x86_64-Minimal-1810.iso
# Login to http://<Photon IP Address>:8080 and you should see the ISO ready for download
# Note: to setup authentication, see this blog: https://www.theorycrafter.org/quipu/creating-a-simple-download-server-with-apache/

# Step 3: change permissions to allow access to files

chmod 644 *

# Step 4: Configure vRA/vRO
## Step 4a: Login to vRO, go to "Resources", create a folder called "VMW-PSO-E2E-AMI-Style-Blueprinting"
## Step 4b: Import the file https://github.com/boconnor2017/vmw-e2e/blob/master/solutions/AMI-Style-Blueprinting/e2e-ami-style-blueprinting-keyvalue.txt

## Step 4c: Import the action https://github.com/boconnor2017/vmw-e2e/blob/master/solutions/AMI-Style-Blueprinting/getListOfAMIFromSWRepo.action

## Step 4d: Import the workflow https://github.com/boconnor2017/vmw-e2e/blob/master/solutions/AMI-Style-Blueprinting/Deploy%20AMI%20Blueprint.workflow

## Step 4e: Login to vRA, create an XaaS Blueprint called "Deploy AMI Blueprint"
##    XaaS Blueprint should map to the "Deploy AMI Blueprint" vRO workflow
##    In the custom request form, add a type "Dropdown" to the variable "nameOfAMI", map the values of the dropdown
##    to pull from "getListOfAMIFromSWRepo" action

## Step 4f: Publish the catalog item, brand with E2E logo and run the "Deploy AMI Blueprint" catalog item
## Expected result: should see a dropdown menu with the following items:
##      - photon-3-base-ova
##
## Select the item from the dropdown. The selected item should provision the appropriate OVA
