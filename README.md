# About Project E2E
Project E2E is an initiative by VMWare Professional Services to streamline the delivery of end to end (E2E) solutions. In this context, a solution is defined as follows:

** Gartner's definition of an enterprise solution **

>An enterprise solution is designed to integrate multiple facets of a companyâ€™s business through the interchange of information from various business process areas.
A solution portfolio defines the relationship among implemented solutions of a particular type (such as an application, or shared infrastructure) in order to coordinate change across those solutions. Applying a portfolio approach to managing solutions as a group, while also managing the relationship across portfolios, improves consistency, interoperability, and portability of the collection of solutions. 

An E2E solution should therefore explicitly define the **people** and **process** required to generate the expected results of a **product**.

**Success Criteria:**
1. People: should contain roles and skillsets that are normally found in enterprise organizations
2. Process: should be repeatable and should always produce the same result
3. Product: should be tangible and should match exactly to the expected result
